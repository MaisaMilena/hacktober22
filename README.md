# Hello, friend!

Welcome to my Hacktober 2022 project! I started working on this but there are some 
missing pieces. Can you help me? ðŸ˜†

- [ ] The app should only be available on portrait mode
- [ ] Create a Lauchscreen
- [ ] Add more Color Set following hacktober palette 
     - light blue
     - light yellow
- [ ] Create and add icon for the app
- [ ] Press the button on `OnboardingView` should go to `HomeView`
- [ ] Messages should not be directly written on code. Enable usage of a 
`Localizable.strings` file to generate an Enum representing String values.
